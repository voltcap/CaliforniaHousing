# CaliforniaHousing
This project explores predictive modelling of California housing prices using a subset of features from the California Housing dataset. The assignment examines the effect of polynomial feature expansion and regularisation techniques on model performance, comparing Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression across multiple polynomial degrees.

The task is structured into six main parts, covering preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualisation.
